# Data Structures and Algorithms

## Pseudo Queue

The PseudoQueue is a JavaScript class that implements a queue data structure using two stacks. It follows the First-In, First-Out (FIFO) principle for managing elements.

## Whiteboard Process

No whiteboard utilized.

## Approach & Efficiency

1. enqueue(value)
- Inserts a value into the PseudoQueue using a first-in, first-out (FIFO) approach.
- Arguments:
  - value (any): The value to be added to the queue.

1. dequeue()
- Extracts a value from the PseudoQueue using a first-in, first-out (FIFO) approach.
- Returns the value removed from the front of the queue.
- If the queue is empty, it returns null.
